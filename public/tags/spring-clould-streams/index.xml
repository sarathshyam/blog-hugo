      <description>Last week, a pull request that I created for fixing a bug in Spring cloud stream kafka streams binder got accepted. It feels really awesome :). I ran into this defect while building a stream processing application using kafka streams for a monitoring tool that I was building at work(which started as a hobby project).
More than anything else, to me, the most important take away from this opportunity was to understand and navigate an un-familiar code base to see where it breaks and the impact of the fix.</description>
