I am a software engineer specialising in architecture, design and development of enterprise Java applications. A decade in the industry, and still trying to figure out the craft of programming and engineering in general. 

I use Java stack at work, but love using Python for my personal projects. My other interests include Cars, Mountain Biking and I love reading all tech stuff.

A while back I started this journey to become a well rounded and well grounded software engineer and thus this blog was born.
