Last week, a [pull request](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-binder-kafka/pull/362) that I created for fixing a bug in Spring cloud stream kafka streams binder got accepted. It feels really awesome :). I ran into this defect while building a stream processing application using kafka streams for a monitoring tool that I was building at work(which started as a hobby project).

More than anything else, to me, the most important take away from this opportunity was to understand and navigate an un-familiar code base to see where it breaks and the impact of the fix. On top of it, get to read and learn from a very mature code base.

This sure is a motivation for moreâ€™n more open source involvement.
