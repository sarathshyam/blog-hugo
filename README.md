# blog-hugo
My [Blog](https://www.sarathshyam.in) using the Hugo static site generator. Theme used is a modified version of the [Hyde-hyde](https://github.com/htr3n/hyde-hyde) theme. The original theme was a two column theme with sidebar on the left, I did a quick hack to make it the way that I wanted. Refer [here](https://github.com/sarathshyam/blog-hugo/tree/master/themes/hyde-hyde) for the modified theme.
